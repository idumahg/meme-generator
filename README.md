## Overview of project
The goal of this project is to build a "meme generator" â€“ a multimedia application to dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote. 

The quotes come from a variety of file types (PDF, TXT, DOCX and TXT). Hence we engineer a solution to extract each quote line-by-line from these files and save the images. 

There are sample quotes and images of Xander the pup in the data folder. However, the app also accepts dynamic user input through a command-line tool and a web service. 

With the flask web service, users can provide any image, together with a quote (with a body and author), and get an image with the quote inscribed onto the image.

## Instruction for setting up
* Install the dependencies by running 
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* To start the flask server run the following in terminal:
  ```
  python3 app.py
  ```
  This will provide a link where the server is located. The link will lead you to web service, where you caneither decide to generate a random image or create an image. To create an image, you will need to provide the image url, a quote and an author. 
* The images will be saved in the static folder.
* You can also get a random image by running the *meme.py* code in command line as described below.
* 
## General info
* Quote Engine: This module is composed of classes that ingest different file types that contain quotes. It contains:
  * An abstract base class **IngestorInterface** that contains class method signature.
  * An **Ingestor** class that realize the **IngestorInterface** class and encapsulates all the ingestors to provide one interface to load any supported    file type.
  * A **QuoteModel** class to encapsulate the body and author of a quote.
  * Ingestor classes (DocxIngestor, TextIngestor, PDFIngestor, CSVIngestor) to ingest file types.
* *meme.py* is a simple CLI code that can be run from the terminal. It takes in three *optional* CLI arguuments:
  * \--body: a string quote body
  * \--author: a string quote author
  * \--path: an image path
  
  The script returns a path to a generated image. If any argument is not defined, a random selection is used.
* *app.py* is a flask server code. This code uses the Quote Engine Module and Meme Generator Modules to generate a random captioned image. It uses the *requests* package to fetch an image from a user submitted URL.
* The HTML templates files are given in *templates/*
* Example quotes are provided in   _./\_data/SimpleLines_ and  _./\_data/DogQuotes_
